  <h1>about me.</h1>
  <p>
   I am a Business Computing student at TUD (Technological University of Dublin).
    I just finished my 1st year course and I wanted to advance more in my field.
    So, I created this website to learn, practice, and document my journey.
    From knowing little to none to publishing a fully functioning website.
